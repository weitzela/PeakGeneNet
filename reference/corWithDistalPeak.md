Iteration of correlations between distal peaks and other peaks residing
near it with significant relationships with said gene

## Usage

``` r
corWithDistalPeak(df, full_cor_df, count_mat, iter = 1, iter_batch_cutoff = 5)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  dataframe of significant correlation results

- full_cor_df:

  dataframe of full correlation results

- count_mat:

  matrix of counts supplied to correlation analysis

## Value

dataframe with correlation results for that particular iteration
